## 1. Introduction

Taking care of interior plants can be a challenging task, especially for those who are new to gardening or have a busy lifestyle. Fortunately, mobile applications can help users keep their plants healthy and thriving. There are already several plant care apps available, such as Planta, Gardenia, and Biophilia, that provide users with information on watering, fertilizing, and potting requirements for different types of plants. However, there is still room for improvement in terms of user experience and features.

With this project we will be focusing on developing an application from the start based on the Elements of the User Experience from Jesse James Garrett to study and learn about this aproach that prioritizes the final user needs.

## 2. Strategy

The first step under the Elements of User Experience is the Strategy plane, which focuses on incorporating not only what the people running the application want to get out of it but what the users want to get out of the application.

From this aproach, a Value Proposition Canvas is used to determined what the people wants to earn from our solution and how are we gonna respond to those needs.
